## Rock Paper Scissors

Build a rock, [paper and scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) with Node.js, `readline` and the npm package `figlet`.

When the game starts, it should ask the player to choose `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`.

The computer should choose a random option of `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.

Write some logic to figure out the winner or if there is a tie.

There should be a console log that prints out the player and computer choice. Similar to

> "Player chose rock and computer chose paper."

For each possible play.

Then, using figlet, print one of the following messages

- "Player wins!"
- "Computer wins!"
- "It's a tie!"
